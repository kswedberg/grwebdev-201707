# Presentation for Grand Rapids JavaScript Meetup, 25 July 2017 Edit

To run this locally, you must first have node.js 4+ and (optionally) yarn installed. Then:

* Clone this repo and cd into the directory
* Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
* Run `npm run build` or `yarn build`
* Start a server on localhost with `public/` as the doc root. (I use the `[http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)` node module for that, because it's easy.)
